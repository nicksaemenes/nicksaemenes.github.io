This is my webpage.
I began my design career as primarily a print designer, but have transitioned into the world of the www.

My portfolio is a PDF, but I have collected some of my favorite web techniques, I have collected over the years, on this page, both to show what I have found, but also that I can combine these techniques to create a functional page.

Photo credits go to my bro-in-law Nick Anderson.
